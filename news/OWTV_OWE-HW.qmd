  On July 23 at 5:30pm, the Humboldt Bay Harbor District will unveil its visual simulations of the heavy lift terminal it is proposing to assemble offshore wind turbines that would be installed 20-30 miles offshore in the Humboldt Wind Lease Area. Although the size of these turbines has yet to be determined, they are likely to be around 900 feet tall - about three times taller than the former pulp mill smokestack in Samoa.Drone image by Oren Nardi.
