    "text": "Moorings are the below-water components of the floating offshore wind platform that connect the platform to its anchoring points on the seabed. Moorings can be made of polyester, polypropylene, or other synthetic material, and/or steel cables and chain. There are several different mooring designs that can be used for floating offshore wind, depending on water depth, type of platform, and environmental conditions. Most likely, moorings for California offshore wind will be taut to restrict the movement of the platform, the affected seabed area, and the amount of extra material in the water.\nThe less material in the water, the less chance of entanglement with wildlife like baleen whales. The risk of marine life becoming directly entanglement with a floating offshore wind mooring system (“primary entanglement”) is low. However, marine debris, such as lost fishing gear, may become caught in floating offshore wind mooring lines, which could potentially pose a risk to entanglement of marine life. This is termed “secondary entanglement”. More research is needed to fully evaluate risks of secondary entanglement to marine life."

    "text": "There are two primary subsea cables in offshore wind: Interarray and export cables. Export cables transmit power from the offshore substation to the onshore substation. Once they reach shallower waters, these cables are buried beneath the seafloor to avoid disturbing ocean users and wildlife. Interarray cables connect individual floating offshore wind turbine platforms to one another and to a substation to transmit the power being generated. These cables are likely to be suspended relatively loosely in the water column using floats in deeper waters, or run along the seafloor in shallower waters. The size of these cables is large enough that they are unlikely to directly entangle wildlife (primary entanglement). However, marine debris, such as lost fishing gear, may become caught in floating offshore wind mooring lines, which could potentially pose a risk to entanglement of marine life. This is termed “secondary entanglement”. More research is needed to fully evaluate risks of secondary entanglement to marine life."

The substation also includes equipment for monitoring and controlling the power flow and for protecting the system against faults. These substations are typically located near the offshore energy generation site and are built on platforms or structures that can withstand the harsh marine environment. They are designed to be weather-resistant and corrosion-resistant to ensure they can operate safely and reliably for many years."

    "text": "Adapted from the Tethys site: Commercial interest in developing floating wind energy in the deep waters of the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf has raised questions about whales and other large cetaceans potentially encountering the mooring lines and electrical cables from a floating offshore wind farm. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory created an animated simulation of a humpback whale mother and her calf swimming through a hypothetical floating offshore wind farm to visualize the scale of the whales compared to the scale of the wind farm’s underwater components. This simulation helps characterize the risk of whale encounters with mooring lines and electrical cables. The floating wind farm shown in the video is a hypothetical but realistic depiction of what could be installed off the U.S. west coast and Hawaii. Humpbacks were chosen as the whale species to depict because of their presence in the Pacific Region and their large pectoral fins—appendages that could make them more likely to encounter the mooring lines and electrical cables if they are swimming nearby.\nSource: Exploring Encounters between Humpback and Floating Wind Farms | PNNL"

Increasing the abundance of marine renewable energy (MRE) projects would expand a clean and renewable energy portfolio that supports job creation, economic prosperity, and energy security, reduces greenhouse gases, and contributes to climate change mitigation. However, as is the case with any development process, MRE projects require informed and collaborative project planning to overcome significant sociocultural, ecological and environmental, and economic barriers that may limit responsible and accelerated deployment. This challenge is exacerbated by competing values held by a diverse set of communities."

Collaborative planning is critical to any offshore development, as well as for upgrades to existing infrastructure and construction of new infrastructure to support expanding and emerging marine activities.\nThis community-driven story building tool will contribute to effective and equitable offshore development planning processes for a number of maritime sectors, and will benefit sociocultural, ecological and environmental, regulatory, and technological challenges, all of which will contribute to economic benefits to communities while respecting environmental justice issues."
