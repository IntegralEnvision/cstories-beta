---

An offshore substation is a facility used to convert the high-voltage electricity generated by offshore wind turbines or wave and tidal energy systems to a lower voltage that can be safely transported to the mainland via undersea cables. The substation also includes equipment for monitoring and controlling the power flow and for protecting the system against faults. These substations are typically located near the offshore energy generation site and are built on platforms or structures that can withstand the harsh marine environment. They are designed to be weather-resistant and corrosion-resistant to ensure they can operate safely and reliably for many years.
