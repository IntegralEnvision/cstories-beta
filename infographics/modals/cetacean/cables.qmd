There are two primary subsea cables in offshore wind: Interarray and export cables. Export cables transmit power from the offshore substation to the onshore substation. Once they reach shallower waters, these cables are buried beneath the seafloor to avoid disturbing ocean users and wildlife. Interarray cables connect individual floating offshore wind turbine platforms to one another and to a substation to transmit the power being generated. These cables are likely to be suspended relatively loosely in the water column using floats in deeper waters, or run along the seafloor in shallower waters. The size of these cables is large enough that they are unlikely to directly entangle wildlife (primary entanglement). However, marine debris, such as lost fishing gear, may become caught in floating offshore wind mooring lines, which could potentially pose a risk to entanglement of marine life. This is termed “secondary entanglement”. More research is needed to fully evaluate risks of secondary entanglement to marine life.
