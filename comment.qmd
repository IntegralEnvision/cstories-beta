Use the Comment system available in the extra menu in the upper right corner to highlight and comment, also known as "Annotate", on any text from Infographics to News items.

To use Annotations, you will need to be logged into a free [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) account. Access the Hypothes.is Sign up/Log in page by clicking on the arrow on the upper right hand side of the page:
